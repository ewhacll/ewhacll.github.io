long_detail: "Dr. Yim explained the importance of pragmatic social skills in children and the motivation for developing the program for Crewdy. The program was planned to enhance children's pragmatic skills via dialogic book reading. Acccording to the article, Dr. Yim said,'If you ask me what is the important factor for a child to have a healthy life, I will answer without hesitation that it is a language success. This is because good communication and language make them better able to engage in socialization as well as making the healthy family engagement. Language development is essential for all aspects of their education, and throughout their lives as they grow into adulthood. I developed the pragmatic social skills program with Crewdy because a lot of children are struggling with social skills due to the pandemic. This program is based on the results of our lab's study, and we hope that children will be able to enjoy this evidence-based online classes.
