description: "Hello! My name is Si-Hyeon Choi, and I am currently participating as an intern in this research lab. I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Korea Nazarene University and am presently working as a speech-language pathologist specializing in language therapy for children. For my Master's thesis, I conducted intervention research focusing on parent education programs for parents of children with delayed language development. Through this experience, I realized the critical importance of delivering high-quality parent education, which has since become one of my primary areas of interest. I am deeply committed to exploring the intricate factors that influence children's language development and aspire to provide Evidence-Based Practice to the diverse range of children I will encounter in the future. My ultimate goal is to grow as a skilled SLP and researcher dedicated to advancing effective therapies and making a meaningful impact in this field."
