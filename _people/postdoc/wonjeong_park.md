description: I am Wonjeong Park, a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Communication Disorders, Ewha Womans University. I have earned both my master's and doctoral degrees in Speech-Language Pathology from Ewha Womans University. My doctoral dissertation was focused on the assessment of vocabulary development in pre-school-aged children using multi-source data. Currently, I am conducting research on novel approaches to child language assessment/intervention that combine traditional methods with technology.
