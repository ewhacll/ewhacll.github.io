description: I am a current undergraduate student at Korea University, double majoring in English Education and Language and Literacy Education.  I am broadly interested in the language and literacy development of children from diverse backgrounds, including bilingual children, children with language difficulties, and children from different socioeconomic statuses. I am very grateful to be a part of the Child Language Lab and am excited to learn and grow as a future researcher during my time here.
