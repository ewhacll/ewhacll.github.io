description: I am a current undergraduate student at Northwestern University, majoring in Communication Sciences and Disorders and Psychology. I joined this lab out of curiosity and an interest for researching language development and skills in bilingual children. The CLL lab gives me the opportunity to engage with professionals and graduate students who share similar passions and to observe how speech therapy is approached and implemented in Korean society. In the future, I hope to become a certified SLP who specializes in treatment for individuals with speech-related disorders. In my free time, I love going on road trips and trying new eateries!
