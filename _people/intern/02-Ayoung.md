description: Hello! I am Ayoung Kim.Â I am an undergraduate student in the College of Liberal Studies at Seoul National University, majoring in psychology and linguistics. I am interested in language development as a whole, especially how basic cognitive requirements affect language development. It is an honor to work with such good people and I hope I can learn and grow a lot in CLL.
