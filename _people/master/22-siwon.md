description: Hello, this is Siwon Hong. I completed my bachelor’s degree in English and psychology, where I first discovered my interest in linguistics and bilingualism. I am now pursuing a graduate degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University, with a growing interest in how language interacts with children’s development. I hope to become a clinician who can bring meaningful and positive change to children’s lives by helping them find and express their own voice.
