description: Hello! I received my BA in English Education and am pursuing MA in Communication Disorders, both at Ewha Womans University. My research interests are in language acquisition and language development, and I have a particular interest in bilingualism. I am happy to join Child Language Lab, and hope to become a good researcher and SLP with eyes for details and a heart for empathy!
