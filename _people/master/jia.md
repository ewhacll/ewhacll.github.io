description: Hello, I am Jia Han. Fascinated by being an SLP, I got my BA in Communication Disorders and studying for MA in the same field. I love children, and I enjoy spending time with them. I am excited to join Child Language Lab and to do studies together with new people! Please cheer me up for my new days to come!
