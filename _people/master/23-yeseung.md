description:Hello, this is Yeseung Choi. I have a bachelor’s degree in Sociology.  I am pursuing my Master’s degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. Through working with children with ASD and language delays, I was introduced to the field of Speech and Language Pathology. While teaching these students, I developed a strong passion in supporting their communication and linguistic development. In particular, I am interested in parent coaching and bilingual children with speech and language impairments. I hope to continue expanding my knowledge in these areas and contribute to meaningful, evidence-based intervention for diverse learners.
