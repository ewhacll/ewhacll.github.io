description:  Hello, my name is Kyungjin Cho. I hold a master’s degree in Education and have worked as an elementary school teacher. Interacting with diverse learners in the classroom naturally led me to develop a strong interest in reading disabilities and learning disorders.
 My primary interests are on developing assessments that accurately capture children’s learning and language development, as well as designing effective interventions that lead to meaningful change. I hope to continue exploring ways to enrich children’s learning experiences and bridge practical research with everyday educational practice
