description: "Hi, I studied TESOL & linguistics as B. A. at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. Also I had taught some adolescents English for several years in South Korea. That experience led me to rethink why some students can't acquire foreign language successfully regardless of equivalent language input. I came here to find out the answer. My research interests are bilingualism, foreign language acquisition, and multiculturalism. I'm looking forward to investing in children, who are all adorable."
