description: Hello! I got my B.A. with a double major in social studies education and psychology. And I am currently pursuing M.A. in the department of Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. I'm interested in children's language development and children who have difficulties with language use. I really want to be a good SLP to help many children with communication disorders! :)
