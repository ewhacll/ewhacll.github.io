description: Hello. I earned baccalaureate in English Education. I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Communication Disorders. I believe my knowledge about non-disordered language acquisition and teaching experience would be a solid foundation for further study. My current research interests are bilinguals and cognitive underlying mechanism. I am happy to be a member of Child Language Lab and this will definitely help lead me to the way on my professional journey in the field.
