description: "I completed a bachelor's course in speech pathology hearing rehabilitation, and I am currently studying for a master's degree in communication disability at Ewha Womans University. I am currently working as a language pathologist at the Child Development Center and working with international relief organizations to provide literacy classes to children in daycare centers. Through these activities, Iâ€™m trying not only to have deep understand on language disorders, parental education and dyslexia but also to solve language and reading writing problems for children. By developing expertise in CLL thorugh active study and research, I want to contribute to the research and treatment fields for children who have language disorders."
