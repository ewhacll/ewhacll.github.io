description: "Hello, this is Minsu Park.  I hold a bachelor's degree in English literature and linguistics, where I cultivated a deep interest in phonetics. My passion for speech and language was further strengthened during a year of research in a phonetics lab, where I developed a profound appreciation for the complexities of speech perception and production. I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. I am committed to the belief that everyone deserves a voice, and I aspire to provide individuals with the tools and support necessary to discover and express their own."
