description: Hello everyone! My name is Songyi Kim. I got my bachelor's degree in Special Education and I'm currently pursuing MA in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. I've worked with kids with ASD before coming here and now, I'm particularly interested in language acquisition/development, bilingualism and parent training. I'm excited to be a member of Child Language Lab. I look forward to learning and growing here at CLL and hope to become a competent, yet warm-hearted SLP in the near future.
