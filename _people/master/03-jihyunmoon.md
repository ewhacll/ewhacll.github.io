description: "Hello. I'm Jihyun Moon. I majored in German and Child Education and I am currently in the master's course at Ewha Womans University. Studying these two fields made me interested in children's language development and especially I became interested in process of language learning and bilingualism. I hope to become a competent SLP while studying in CLL."
