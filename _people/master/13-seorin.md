description: "After receiving my B.A. in English and International Child Education, I am currently pursuing M.A. in Communication Disorders.Growing up as a TCK, I was intrigued by the thought of bilingualism and its acquisition. It is a sheer joy to learn that I can be of help to those who are growing up or grew up in similar background as mine with language. I look forward to explore and research more about children, their language, and ways to better their lives."
