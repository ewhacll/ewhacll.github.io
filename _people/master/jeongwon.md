description: Hello! My name is Jeongwon Choi and I am a graduate student at Ewha Womans University. I received B.A. in Linguistics at University of Washington-Seattle. My fields of interest are language development in bilingual and multicultural children, and parent training. I always loved working with children so I am very excited to be a part of CLL.
