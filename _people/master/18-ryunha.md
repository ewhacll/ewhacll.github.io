description: "Hello, I'm Ryunha Lee. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Korean Language Education and Korean Language and Literature, and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. During my studies in education, I have experienced the profound impact of language on a child's education and overall lifespan. I am particularly interested in the general language development of children in various environmental conditions. As I train to become a professional SLP, I aim to engage in meaningful research at CLL that can help children with SLI communicate more effectively with the wider world."
