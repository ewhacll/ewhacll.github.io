description: "Hello, I’m Nahyun Kim. I majored in speech pathology hearing rehabilitation for my bachelor’s degree. Currently, I’m pursuing a master's degree in speech-language pathology at Ewha Womans University because I want to learn speech-language pathology more in-depth. I’m very interested in children development, so I’m excited to join CLL and conduct a variety of research regarding the topic. I will strive to become a speech rehabilitator who can continuously conduct language research and treatment for children."
