description: "Hello! I am Charyeong. I hold a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education from Ewha Womans University, and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Communication Disorders at the same institution. During my time working in a kindergarten, I had the opportunity to meet numerous children grappling with language difficulties, alongside their concerned parents. Witnessing their challenges firsthand deeply moved me and instilled in me a strong desire to advocate for their needs. I am particularly passionate about child language development, learning disabilities, and providing guidance and support to parents. My fervent enthusiasm lies in conducting research on language acquisition and contributing towards crafting brighter and more fulfilling lives for children."
