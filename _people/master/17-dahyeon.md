description: "Hello, my name is Park Dahyeon. I graduated from the Department of Creative Writing in high school and later earned my degree in Korean Language and Literature at university. Currently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in children's language development and narrative comprehension. Through my graduate coursework on the mechanisms of language development, I aspired to conduct research in this field. I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to collaborating at CLL."
