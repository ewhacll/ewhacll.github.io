description: As a mother of three and a primary caregiver to a child with language developmental challenges, my initial engagement with communication disorders was driven by a personal need to better understand and support my child. This personal motivation has evolved into a professional pursuit, guiding me to the Department of Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. I am committed to advancing my expertise as a speech-language pathologist. My goal is supporting children with communication barriers by enhancing their confidence, functional communication ability, and quality of life.
