description: "Hello, I got a bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Cognitive Sciencesand Spanish Interpretation and Translation. And Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's degree in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. At university, I was interested in comparative phoneme analysis in Korean and Spanish, which led me to continue my interest in bilingual children's research. Also, while working at a non-profit organization, I encountered North Korean teenagers who are suffering from communication difficulties.Accordingly, I would like to create a better language learning environment for multicultural children to escape from the absence of language stimulation and study effective treatment methods for them. My research interests include bilingual, multicultural children including North Korean children."
