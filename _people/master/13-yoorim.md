description: "Hello, I’m currently pursuing MA in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. I got BA in Business Administration but I studied Communication Disorders for 2 years before I transferred to other school. Meanwhile, there were moments that made me realize ‘How important language is in people's lives.’ I decided to study Communication Disorders again and I became more enthusiastic about the study than before. My research interests are child’s language development and bilingual children. I’m looking forward to participating in excellent research in CLL and I really hope to help all children who have difficulties in language!"
