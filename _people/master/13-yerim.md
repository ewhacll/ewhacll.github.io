description: Hi! I did a bachelor's degree in speech patholgy at the University of Sydney, worked as a speech pathologist for a short while in Australia and currently in the midst of a masters course in speech language pathology at Ewha Woman's University. Being a bilingual myself and having grown up in a multicultural community with many culturally and linguistically diverse people around me I became interested in the bilingual population.  My research interests are mainly to do with the pediatric bilingual population but I'm also interested in early language intervention and ASD.
