description: "I earned my bachelor's degree in French, driven by my strong interest in languages. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in speech-language pathology, a field where language becomes a tool for healing. My academic interests focus on the underlying mechanisms of language development and the processes through which children acquire language. I am particularly intrigued by bilingual families. Through in-depth study and diverse research, I aim to provide truly effective interventions in the future. My hope is that speech therapy can empower individuals to lead better lives and bring greater richness to families."
