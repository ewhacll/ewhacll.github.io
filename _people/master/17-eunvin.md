description: "Hello! I am Eunvin. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and German Language and Literature at Ewha, and I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. For a long time, I have been interested in languages and the process of how a language is learned. As a person who was constantly exposed to circumstances where I should keep learning more than two languages, I always contemplate what a language is. Now I believe that every language, regardless of user and setting, is a powerful means that connect people with the whole world and society. I am eager to research and learn more about language learning, multilingualism and children, and be a part of helping individuals having better lives."
