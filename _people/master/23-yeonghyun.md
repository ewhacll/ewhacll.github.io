description: "Hello! I am YeongHyun. I earned a bachelor's degree in Education and Korean Language and Literature at Sungkyunkwan University. Currently I am pursuing a master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. Although I initially majored in Education, my interest in language shifted toward a therapeutic view rather than an educational one, which motivated me to pursue studies in Speech-Language Pathology. Moreover I am also interested in parental education, as children's language development is most significantly influenced by their home environment. Accordingly I have engaged with CLL to pursue advanced research in this area."
