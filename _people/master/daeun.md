description: Hello! I got my bachelor's degree with a double major in English Language & Literature and Cognitive Science and am currently pursuing my MA in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. I am interested in children's language development, language acquisition, and language processing. I hope to become a SLP who truly helps children with communication disorders.
