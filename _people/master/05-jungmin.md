description: "Hello, I'm Jungmin Woo. I got a bachelor's degree in Russian Language and Cultural&Contents Studies, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. While participating in a student exchange program in Russia, I volunteered to teach Korean to children from multicultural families. It was during this experience that I developed a deep interest and passion for assisting others in language-related matters. Through in-depth research and diverse experiences in CLL, I aspire to become a sincere and professional speech-language pathologist."
