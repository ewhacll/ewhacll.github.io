description: "Hi, I am currently working on my M.A. in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. I’ve worked at various different fields before continuing my education after college. I received my B.S. in Communication & Education: Communication & Leadership Development, specializing in Leadership at the University of Florida, and I am an American TESOL certified teacher for K-12. As a single mother of two lovely children, I am particularly interested in children’s brain function and development as well as bilingual cross-cultural studies."
