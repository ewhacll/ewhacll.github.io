description: Hello! I am Sojeong Kwon. I got my B.A in Brain & Cognitive science and Korean Language at Ewha womans university. I worked at several neuro/cognitive science labs related to brain diseases and language. These experiences made me pursue M.A in the department of Communication Disorder and join CLL. I am currently interested in the mechanism of language acquisition and bilingualism. I hope I can help children who have a hard time with using language and do some fascinating research.
