description: "Hello! I want to be a joyful, playful, lively speech-language pathologist and a professional researcher, who always can refresh children and lead them to improvement from their current stage. I got a B.A. in Psychology and I am currently pursuing my M.A. in Ewha. My interests in this area include the underlying mechanism of PLI children and bilingual, multicultural children who have difficulty with their communication ability and overall self-esteem. No child should feel alone, I want to search for a way to make them keep going forward!"
