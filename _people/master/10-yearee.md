description: "Hello, my Bachelorâ€™s degree is in English Language and Literature and I am currently in a master's degree program in speech and language pathology at Ewha. During college years I worked as an English and sports teacher and enjoyed every bit of the experience. Naturally I became interested in ways to improve children's wellness and quality of life. So far my areas of interest are cognitive processes underlying language disorders and Alternative and Augmentative Communication, but I won't stop looking for more and delving into learning opportunities while I'm at CLL!"
