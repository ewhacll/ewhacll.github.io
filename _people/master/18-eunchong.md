description: 'Language is a tool.'
At the Child Language Lab (CLL), these words capture the essence of our work-understanding how children use this tool and how we can help them use it more effectively. I walk this journey with the team as a master's student in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. I work to learn, explore, and contribute to our shared work. My research interests include child language development and bilingualism. 

And as Buzz Lightyear says, 'To infinity and beyond!' (Toy Story, 1995)
