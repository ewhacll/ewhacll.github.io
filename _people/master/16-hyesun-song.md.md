description: Hello, I am Hyesun Song. I am currently pursing M.A in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. Before pursuing my M.A, I received a B.A in Early-Child Education at Ewha and got certified as a Early Childhood Educator as well as a Child Care Teacher. I hope to combine the knowledge of the two majors through the master's course. Meanwhile, my research interests include language acquisition, foreign language education, and bilingual children. I am very excited to learn more about the field at CLL.
