description: "Hello, I'm Hyejin Joo. I got my BA degree in speech pathology and Iâ€™m currently pursuing MA in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. While studying, I became interested in North Korean defectors and bilingual children. I'm excited to be a member of CLL. I will become a SLP who constantly learns and grows through training at CLL. Thank you."
