description: "Hello, my name is Yeoeun Yoon. I hold a degree in Early Childhood Education and have several years of experience working as a kindergarten teacher. Through my teaching experience, I had the opportunity to work with children experiencing language delays, which deepened my understanding of the vital role of early language acquisition. This experience inspired me to pursue a master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. I am particularly interested in supporting children raised in bilingual environments and those with language development delays. My goal is to conduct meaningful research at CLL that enables children to express their emotions and thoughts freely and promotes their healthy growth and development."
