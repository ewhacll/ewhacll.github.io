description: "Hello, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Education and Korean Language and Literature at Yonsei University. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. While working as a high school teacher, I developed an interest in students with language impairments and became eager to assist them. My passion lies in children's language development, language disorders, and learning disabilities, which drives my aspiration to conduct research in these areas in the future!"
