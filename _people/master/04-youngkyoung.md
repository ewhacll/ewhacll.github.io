description: "Hi! I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in English Language and Literature from Yonsei University and I’m currently working on my master’s degree in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. During my year as an exchange student at the University of Bath, I came across the concept of multiple Englishes which deconstructs the ownership of language and emphasizes the role of language as a tool for communication. It helped my lifelong anxiety in English, which is my second language, and ever since I've learned to appreciate the experience of being connected with the power of  language. My research interests include multilingualism, code-mixing, and language acquisition and breakdowns. I am looking forward to being an SLP and a researcher who values the quality of life that language can bring and helps individuals connect with the world around them."
