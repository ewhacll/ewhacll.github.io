description: Hi. I have a BA degree in Education and a minor in Business Administration. While working at a secondary school in Vancouver and a psychology counseling center in Seoul, I became interested in individuals who have communication disorders for diverse reasons. I believe communication is one of the most valuable abilities that connects us with those close to us and with the greater world, so I would like to be a door that connects people to every aspect of their world. I am especially interested in treating the pediatric bilingual population, as well as children who have language difficulties due to hearing loss or ASD.
