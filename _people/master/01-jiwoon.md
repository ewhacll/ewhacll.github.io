description: Hi! I got my BA in Linguistics at Korea University and am currently studying for a MA in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. During my undergraduate degree I found it fascinating that children nearly master their first language in such short time and I got interested in language development and language disorders in children. Especially, I have a great interest in bilingual and multicultural children. I hope to make changes with my heart and mouth and ears. Cheers!
