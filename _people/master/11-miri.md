description: "Hello! I received my bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature and Economics. I furthered my studies in New Zealand, specializing in Early Childhood Education and Care, as well as TESOL. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. My research interests revolve around the language acquisition of children from diverse backgrounds, temperament, and parent training. I aspire to deepen my expertise through in-depth research at CLL and become a competent Speech-Language Pathologist."
