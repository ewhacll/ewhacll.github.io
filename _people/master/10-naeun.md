description: Hello! My name is Naeun Lim. I have a BA degree in Korean Language and Literature for major and Korean Education for minor. While teaching students, I met a few students who have communication disorder. So I'm interested in learning how to help the children with langugage impairment and process of language development. I'm so excited to be a member of CLL and want to be a good SLP!
