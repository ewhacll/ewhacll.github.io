description: "Hi, I am Yuri Cho. I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Library Information Science and Social Welfare, and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. During my studies, I met children with developmental disabilities and borderline intelligence. While interacting with them, I clearly recognized the power of language as a means of communication, expression, and protection. I am interested in language development in children with developmental disabilities and borderline intelligence, and dyslexia. I am willing to learn and engage in research that supports children with language development needs."
