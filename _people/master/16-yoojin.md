description: Hi, Iâ€™ve loved to play with young children since I was young. So, I wanted to study about Children and have a BA degree in Children Education. When I practiced at a daycare center, I desired to help child with language difficulties. Then, I entered a MA course in Communication Disorders, and joined the CLL. I am devoting all my passion to studying and researching children with language impairment and bilinguals at Ewha Womans University. I will do my best to be a good SLP.
