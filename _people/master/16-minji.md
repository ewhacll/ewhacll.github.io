description: "I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Ewha Womans University and am pursuing a Master's in Speech-Language Pathology at the same institution. My lifelong passion for languages sparked my curiosity about the mechanisms of language acquisition. During my exchange program at Waseda University, I immersed myself in a multilingual and multicultural environment, broadening my perspective on language use in diverse settings. These experiences have shaped my research interests in bilingualism and language acquisition, and I am eager to contribute valuable insights to this field through my endeavors."
