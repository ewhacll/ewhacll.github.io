description: "Hello! I got a bachelor's degree in Child Studies and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. Throughout the bachelor's course, I learned that parents are the most influential caregivers for early-school children and promote children's language development when parents interact with them in a reactive way. Accordingly, I think that parent training is necessary to strengthen parents' capabilities to support language development in children's language treatment, and I would like to study this in-depth. Also, I want to be a competent SLP who can have a positive influence on childhood, which is a critical period of language development. Training at CLL will be a good opportunity for me and I'm looking forward to it."
