description: "Hello, Iâ€™m Seohui Lee. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Child Studies and Art Therapy Counseling, and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University. While studying Child Studies, I realized the crucial role of communication skills and effective parenting coaching in supporting a child's developmental process. I am training to become a professional SLP to help children develop through diverse experiences, and I aim to conduct research in various fields at CLL."
