description: "Hello, this is Jieun Lee. I hold a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education and am currently pursuing a master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology. Through volunteering as a teacher, I encountered many children struggling with language difficulties, which deepened my interest in this field.  I have a particular passion for parent education, as I believe it is essential to help parents better understand and actively support their child's language development. I also find great fulfillment in helping children freely and confidently express their thoughts and feelings. Moving forward, I aspire to become a strong advocate and resource for both parents and children, and to contribute to creating positive changes in child language development through research and practice."
