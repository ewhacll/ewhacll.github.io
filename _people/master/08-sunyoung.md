description: Hello! I am Sunyoung Kim. I earned a B.A. in Early-Child Education from Ewha Womans University. After graduation, I worked in a kindergarten for three years. While working, I gained an interest in children with language impairments. As a member of the CLL lab, I want to study the foundations of language and learn how to treat linguistic difficulties efficiently. I hope to become a warm SLP to help all children reach their language goals and be happy!
