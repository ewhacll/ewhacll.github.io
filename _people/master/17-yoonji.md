description: Hello, my name is Yoonji Park. I earned my bachelor's degree in Linguistics. I'm pursuing a master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology at Ewha Womans University.  I am especially interested in children's communication and language development. Through diverse research and hands-on experiences at CLL, I aim to develop strong clinical and research skills and become a professional SLP who helps children communicate and learn more effectively. I would like my expertise to aid many children's language development and to be helpful to children and their families.
