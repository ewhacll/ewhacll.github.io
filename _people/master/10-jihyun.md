description: "Hello ! I'm Jihyun Won. I got a bachelor's degree in Speech Pathology and Rehabilitation Psychology. And Iâ€™m currently pursuing a master's degree in Communication Disorders at Ewha Womans University. I am currently working as a speech-language pathologist in Child Development Center. I am interested in the overall development of children's language, especially SLI children's language and underlying ability, bilingual children's language development, and parent education. I would like to engage in both clinical and research area, hoping that children feel the time they spend with me is fun and helpful. I want to become a competent SLP through various research and experiences in CLL."
