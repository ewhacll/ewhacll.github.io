description: "Hi! I am a first-year doctoral student. I received a B.A. in Communication Sciences and Disorders from the University of Iowa and M.A. in Communication Sciences and Disorders from Ewha Womans University. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked with children with dyslexia as a speech-language pathologist. My research interests include learning mechanisms underlying language acquisition in children, and language and literacy development in linguistically diverse children."
