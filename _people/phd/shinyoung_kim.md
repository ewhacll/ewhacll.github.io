description: I'm both a certified SLP and a doctoral student. At the same time, I'm a long-time researcher in Child Language lab. I got my M.A. in Communication Disorders from EWHA womans university. I wrote my thesis on working memory intervention, and I am still interested in the mechanism that underlies language learning, such as a working memory. I hope I will be a warm-hearted efficient helper to children with language impairment. I believe disorder is only a difference.
