description: Hello, I am Jeewon Jeong, a Ph.D. student. My bachelor’s degree is in Special Education. As a speech-language pathologist (SLP), I’ve met many children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I’ve returned to school to continue my studies on this subject, particularly in issues related to language and development in children. I want to study more effective language assessment and intervention methods based on my clinical experience.
