description: I received a B.A. in Korean Language and Literature and M.A. in Communication Disorders. I wrote my thesis on the syntactic abilities and underlying cognitive factors of children with specific language impairment which remains an area of interest for me. I have been working with children with language disorders in various settings from before pursuing my PhD until now. I am striving to become someone who can positively impact many people, and I am working hard towards that goal.
