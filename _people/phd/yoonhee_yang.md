description: Hi :) Iâ€™m a researcher in EWHA-Child Language Lab. I earned my B.A. in Special Education and my M.A., Ph.D. in Communication Disorders from EWHA Womans University. My research focuses on non-linguistic approach to assess and improve potential linguistic competence of children with primary language impairment. I wrote my dissertation on predictors of word learning such as semantic priming and interference in school-age children with PLI.
