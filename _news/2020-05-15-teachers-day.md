detail: CLL members threw a surprise teacher's day party for professor Yim! Due to COVID-19, CLL members met off-campus and had a great turn out. It is not easy to see each other exclusively through zoom during the semester, so we appreciated the chance to see professor Yim and lab members in person. Happy teacher's day and we love you, professor Yim!
